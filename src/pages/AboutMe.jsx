            <p>Hello! I am so excited to begin my coding journey. I am currently learning code through on online bootcamp course that is teaching me HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT.</p>
            <p>After 14 years as an opera singer, I was ready to make a career shift and software engineering has always been a source of intrigue. I figured it was time to learn how to talk to computers, and create software applications of my very own!</p>
